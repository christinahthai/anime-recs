```{r}
anime = read.csv("anime.csv")


```


#Data Cleaning
```{r}
str(anime)
```
```{r}
#Which columns to  change to character vec
anime = anime %>% mutate(genre = as.character(genre),
                         episodes = as.integer(episodes))


```

```{r}
str(anime)

```


This document seeks to utilize the library *sqldf* to determine the answer to the following questions: <br>

1. Is there a correlation between fan base size and number of episodes?

2. For active members, which genres are most popular (is there a stronger fan base for specific genres)?


#Analysis

##By Genre

```{r}

#Expand the dataframe into genres
anime %>% 
  mutate(genre = map(genre, ~ strsplit(.x, ", ") %>% unlist())) %>% 
  unnest(genre) ->
  shows_by_genre


```
