```{r}
library(sqldf)

anime = read.csv("anime.csv")


```


This document seeks to utilize the library *sqldf* to determine the answer to the following questions: <br>

1. Is there a correlation between fan base size and number of episodes?

2. For active members, which genres are most popular (is there a stronger fan base for specific genres)?

```{r}
action = sqldf("SELECT * FROM anime
               WHERE genre LIKE '%Action%';")
```



```{r}
summary(anime)

```


```{r}
