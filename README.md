# Anime Recommendations
Using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 animes, we seek to do some exploratory analysis and answer some of my personal such as:

1. Is there a correlation between fan base size and number of episodes?

2. For active members, which genres are most popular (is there a stronger fan base for specific genres)?
